LEGAL:
- I had learned the Discords private API and how to use it through a research perspective. I am sharing only for other users to learn about discords API and what you can do with it. I am in no way responsible or liable for any actions that will be taken if another user is to edit or use this code. I personally only compiled this code for my gain in knowledge of Python and private/public APIs and intend no harm. Thank you.
